Searching for text allows you to find a word, or part of a word with in your 
document. To search for word select search from the search menu, then type
the string of letters in the space provided that you wish to find. If you 
want OSTE to find it with capitals(or without caps), select case sensitive.
If you want to find only whole words, select the whole words option. If this
options is NOT selected then OSTE will find all occurances of the wrds you 
want. 
	Example: you want to find the word "can", and you DO NOT select the
	whole words only option, the letters CAN will be highlighted in the
	word CAN't, or CANada.
To replace a word with another use the replace feature. Put the word that you
want replaced in the first field, and the word that you want it replaced with 
in the second field. You have the same options as with serch(case sensitive,
and whole words only), plus 2 additional options. Prompt to replace, asks you
if you want to replace the occurance that it has just found, replace all
