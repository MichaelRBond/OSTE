# OSTE
Over Simplistic Text Editor

I wrote OSTE while in high school. Version 1 was released in 1996.

At the time I was running OS/2 Warp 3 as my operating system and experimenting
with Linux on a second partition. I used OS/2, primarily as a Windowing system so
that I could run more DOS windows/application than Windows allowed me too.

OSTE was my answer to the limited plain text editors available in DOS. It was
written using Borland Pascal 7 with Turbo Vision, and was heavily influenced
by the Borland IDEs.

I've long since lost my Borland Pascal 7 and Turbo Vision disks, so I can't
recompile the source. However, included is oste.exe. It runs fine in DosBox, but
will fail to execute outside of DosBox, in modern versions of windows.

The file oste.doc is the original 'readme' file. It is available via the help
menu in OSTE. I've left the horrible spelling as it was when I released the
software in 1996. Obviously there was no spell checking in plain text editors
back in 1996. :)
